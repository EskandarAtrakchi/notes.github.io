    <h1>Compound Interest Formulas</h1>

    <h2>Daily Compounding:</h2>
    <p>If the interest is compounded daily, the formula would be:</p>
    <p>A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A is the final amount.</li>
        <li>P is the principal amount.</li>
        <li>r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).</li>
        <li>n is the number of compounding periods per year (365 for daily).</li>
        <li>t is the number of years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weekly Compounding:</h2>
    <p>For weekly compounding, the formula is the same as the one you've mentioned earlier:</p>
    <p>A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)</p>
    <p>Where n would be 52 (since there are 52 weeks in a year) and t is the number of years.</p>

    <h2>Monthly Compounding:</h2>
    <p>For monthly compounding, the formula is:</p>
    <p>A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)</p>
    <p>Where n would be 12 (for 12 months in a year) and t is the number of years.</p>

    <h2>Annual Compounding:</h2>
    <p>For annual compounding, you use the basic compound interest formula:</p>
    <p>A = P * (1 + r)^t</p>
    <p>Where t is the number of years.</p>

    <p>Note that 'r' in all these formulas should be the annual interest rate in decimal form.</p>
    <p>If you have an interest rate given for a different period (e.g., monthly or weekly), you will need to convert it to an annual rate before using these formulas.</p>
    <p>Also, the compounding frequency affects the 'n' parameter in the formula, which represents the number of compounding periods per year.</p>
    <p>Remember to choose the appropriate formula based on the compounding frequency you're dealing with, and plug in the values of the principal amount, interest rate, compounding frequency, and time to calculate the final amount.</p>
